DIGI-L&F is a modernized, digital logistics solution for campus-wide lost and found management. Built specifically for kiosk hardware, it bridges the gap between traditional manual logs and complex asset management systems. By leveraging a high-contrast "Cyber-Glass" interface and integrated visual verification (Face ID capture), it creates a transparent audit trail that deters false claims and accelerates the return of items to their rightful owners.
